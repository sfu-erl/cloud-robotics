## Video Explanation of Cloudy Robotics

## Codebase
Codebase is very unorganized, lacks documentation, and is built off of a lot of different technologies so itâ€™s very confusing.

For new projects. they should be started from scratch by transferring and re-organizing whatever code is currently in these two repositories. Contact me if you need any help.

## Key Technologies
- **Arduino** for microcontroller to control motors
- **Raspberry Pi** for interfacing the Arduino to cloud servers
- **Python** and **Socket.IO** running on the Raspberry Pi to interface the Arduino to the cloud servers
- **Node.js** server to allow operation of the robot from a website
- **RTMP** media server to stream video
- **FFmpeg** for streaming video from a connected webcam to the RTMP server
